## **MOSAICAL NFT LENDING PLATFORM: MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) BLUEPRINT**

Dear Mosaical Team,

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) blueprint for the Mosaical NFT lending platform, incorporating the updated technical stack: Alchemy for NFT API, viem and wagmi for smart contract integration, and Solid.js with Bootstrap for the frontend. The MVP focuses on core functionalities to deliver a production-ready platform with essential features for the GameFi market.

## **MVP PHASE DETAILED BLUEPRINT (UPDATED)**

### **1\. Core Objectives (UPDATED)**

The MVP will deliver a production-ready platform with:

* Full-featured user interface for GameFi NFT lending on Saga Protocol **built with Solid.js and Bootstrap**  
* Production-hardened smart contracts with comprehensive multi-chainlet and multi-collection support  
* Fully functional DPO token with trading and liquidity provision  
* Automated graduated liquidation based on real-time oracle data  
* On-chain governance for key protocol parameters  
* Comprehensive GameFi collection registry with automated chainlet integration and metadata parsing
* **Robust frontend interaction with smart contracts using viem and wagmi**
* **Production-grade integration with Alchemy NFT API for reliable and scalable NFT data**
* **Optimized Solid.js and Bootstrap frontend for performance and user experience**

### **2\. Technical Architecture (UPDATED)**

#### **2.1 Smart Contract Finalization**

// Finalized Smart Contract Architecture (No changes in core logic for MVP, focusing on audits and optimizations)

#### **2.2 Oracle Implementation (UPDATED - Production-ready Alchemy Integration)**

// Production-ready Alchemy NFT API Integration

This section details the production implementation of the Oracle, leveraging Alchemy NFT API for reliable and scalable NFT data. The Oracle will aggregate data from multiple sources, with Alchemy serving as a primary source for NFT metadata and floor prices.

**Key Components:**

*   **Off-chain Oracle Service:** A dedicated backend service responsible for fetching data from Alchemy NFT API and other sources. This service will handle API keys securely, manage rate limits, implement retry logic, and perform data validation.
*   **Data Aggregation and Validation:** The service will aggregate data from multiple sources (including Alchemy, chainlet-specific APIs, and potentially other marketplaces) and apply validation rules to ensure data accuracy and prevent manipulation. Weighted averages or other algorithms will be used to determine the final price and utility scores.
*   **On-chain Oracle Contract:** A smart contract on the Saga Protocol chainlet that receives validated data from the off-chain service. This contract will store the latest prices and utility scores, making them accessible to other smart contracts (e.g., LoanManager) via a secure mechanism (e.g., signed data feeds, Chainlink oracles).
*   **Alchemy NFT API Usage:** The off-chain service will utilize key Alchemy NFT API endpoints:
    *   `getNFTsForOwner`: To allow users to view their NFTs within the Mosaical platform.
    *   `getNFTMetadata`: To fetch detailed metadata for individual NFTs, including attributes used for utility score calculation.
    *   `getFloorPrice`: To retrieve collection floor prices from major marketplaces.
    *   `getContractMetadata`: To get details about NFT collections.

**Integration Flow:**

1.  The off-chain Oracle service periodically fetches data from Alchemy and other configured sources.
2.  Data is validated and aggregated to determine the final price and utility scores.
3.  The validated data is sent to the on-chain Oracle contract, typically signed by a trusted oracle operator.
4.  Smart contracts like LoanManager query the on-chain Oracle contract for the latest data when needed (e.g., during loan origination or liquidation checks).

#### **2.3 GameFi Yield Automation**

// GameFi Yield Automation (No changes in core concept for MVP, focusing on robustness and scalability)

#### **2.4 Frontend Implementation (UPDATED - Production-ready Solid.js and Bootstrap)**

// Production-ready Frontend using Solid.js and Bootstrap

This section details the production implementation of the frontend, built with Solid.js and Bootstrap, and integrated with smart contracts using viem and wagmi.

**Key Aspects:**

*   **Optimized Solid.js Components:** Components will be optimized for performance and reusability, leveraging Solid's fine-grained reactivity to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Comprehensive Bootstrap Usage:** Bootstrap will be used extensively for a consistent and responsive UI. Custom themes or components will be developed as needed while adhering to Bootstrap's principles.
*   **Robust viem/wagmi Integration:** The integration with smart contracts will be production-hardened, including comprehensive error handling, transaction status monitoring, and gas management. wagmi's core utilities will be used to provide a seamless wallet connection experience.
*   **State Management:** A well-defined state management strategy using Solid's primitives or a compatible library will ensure the application state is managed efficiently and predictably.
*   **Routing:** A Solid.js-compatible router will be implemented for navigation within the single-page application.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests will be implemented for the frontend code.

**Example (Conceptual) - Viewing User's NFTs:**

```javascript
import { createResource } from 'solid-js';
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi'; // Assuming wagmi core utilities or a Solid adaptation
import { AlchemyNFTPriceOracle } from './alchemyService'; // Your service to interact with Alchemy

const alchemyOracle = new AlchemyNFTPriceOracle("YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY", "YOUR_NETWORK");

function UserNFTs() {
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();

  const [nfts] = createResource(() => isConnected() ? address() : null, async (ownerAddress) => {
    const response = await alchemyOracle.getNFTsForOwner(ownerAddress);
    return response?.ownedNfts || [];
  });

  return (
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2>Your NFTs</h2>
      <Show when={isConnected()} fallback={<p>Please connect your wallet to view your NFTs.</p>}>
        <Show when={!nfts.loading} fallback={<p>Loading NFTs...</p>}>
          <div class="row">
            <For each={nfts()}>
              {(nft) => (
                <div class="col-md-4 mb-4">
                  <div class="card">
                    <img src={nft.media[0]?.gateway} class="card-img-top" alt={nft.title}/>
                    <div class="card-body">
                      <h5 class="card-title">{nft.title}</h5>
                      <p class="card-text">Collection: {nft.contract.name}</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Token ID: {nft.tokenId}</p>
                      {/* Add Deposit button or other actions */}
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              )}
            </For>
          </div>
        </Show>
      </Show>
    </div>
  );
